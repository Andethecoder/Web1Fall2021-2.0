                <p>
                    This service is okay to be used because it provides variety of shows and movies from different genres.<br> It's price can be canceled anytime and it's a good deal to get.<br> There are no extra costs and some of its own shows are good.

                <p>
                    This service is alright but its mobile version doesn't let you rotate your screen both ways.<br> All else is the typical setup of shows (and originals) and movies for the service.<br> They also let you watch the films that come out in theaters on the same day too.

                <p>
                    Its not bad but there are some things missing some more Disney Channel originals as well as some Disney XD shows.<br> Everything else is alright though, it has a great lineup of shows and movies.<br>Another thing thats a problem is when they give you an extra price to watch the films that were released for theaters.

                    It's one of the newer streaming services at this time but it's alright.<br> They mostly have a lot of NBC shows, movies of their own, and a kids section full of variety.<br> There's also a Live TV section where you can watch NBC shows that are airing right now.
